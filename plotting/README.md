# README for the plotting code

### This code follows closely after the original LiveOcean plotting code, but all particle tracking is done in the plot5 code, pfun is now lo_tools/plotting_functions, and I will move to xarray from netCDF.

#### `pan_plot.py` is the driver you use to make plots.  It can be run interactively or from the command line.
